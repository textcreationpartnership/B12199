         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>For, wheras, the Root of al Atheiſme, eſpecially that which is ſecret and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the eye of man: Is this, The foole ſaith in his hart there is no God. Thogh the Lord be in their lips, yet he is not in their reines. In their thoughts they denie him, though they confeſſe him with their lips, God is not in all his thoughts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. Therfore if once, it ſhal bee made good, that our <hi>Thoghts</hi> are to be ordered &amp; brought into ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:176263:20"/> will proue a gracious means to conuince and confound this ſecret Atheiſme.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing, when once we giue the bridle to our looſe &amp; wicked thoughts, as if the Lord had no power ouer them: wee are hereby iuſtly giuen vp by the Lord to all open prophanenes, who wil haue al, or none: who vſually confounds ſuch hypocriſie, with deſperate prophanes: ſo that if we deny him in the heart, to giue him ſpirituall worſhip, he will deny vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, in leauing vs to all groſſe euils for the confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Atheiſm: what better remedy can wee miniſter hereunto: then firſt to purge the fountaine, that the ſtreames may be wholſome.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:176263:21"/> That by the rectifying of the heart and ſubduing the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations thereof, the whole man may bee brought into ſubiection to the obedience of Chriſt. And thus ſhal this holy gouernement of the thoughts prooue a bleſſed meanes to purge out the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Atheiſme of the heart, and ſo to procure a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and vpright conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before men.</p>
               <p>But of theſe things more fully in the concluſion of the Treatiſe. Meane while, as this may ſerue to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſcope of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, ſo for the Method there of take theſe few directions, that ſo wee may the better profit thereby. Concerning the method. Take firſt this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176263:21"/> direction, that ſeeing ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall experience eſpecially of mine owne, and other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates hath beene the chiefe ſpring, that hath yeelded theſe meditation: ſo it muſt be the touchſtone to make triall thereof. As this ſubiect is a myſterie to the carnall man, ſo it is he only that can plough with my Heifer, that ſhall make true benefite thereby. And therfore labor to be found in Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be able to vnfold this ridle: thou ſhalt find the comfort of theſe wholſome obſeruations.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſeeing in theſe experimentall colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that may bee conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to faith which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and aboue the reach of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176263:22"/> reaſon: and ſo many times croſſeth the ſtreame of Art: therefore let this bee thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond direction for profite herein, that thou ſtumble not at ſuch fayling in Art, which I profeſſe my ſelfe herein not ſtrictly to haue ſtood vpon: as in the Deſcriptions, Diuiſions, &amp;c. but rather that thou make vſe of ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Experience as is coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnder a ruder forme, and ſo bleſſe God, for any true light reuealed in theſe euill times, to further thee in ſanctification: and the rather in that the infirmities of man ſhall make more to his glory.</p>

                  <p>Another point of this heauenly wiſedome in wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ouer the Thoughts; ordinary to the elect, where in he exceeds the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, is, a wiſe ſingling out, and encountring of them.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:176263:57"/> neglect not any other, yet principally hee attends ſuch thoughts, as tend this way, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, as it vſually falleth out, that, as he ſhal find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe defectiue in one grace more then another: as his heart is enflmed with a loue to al Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and to ſuch graces as may further to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance hereof; ſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doth hee thinke vpon moſt, what hee wants moſt: and ſo labours to enlarge and quicken his thoughts thereunto by prayer, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And hence proceedeth another branch of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly wiſedome: that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, it is then beſt to enlarge

As for the Hypocrite it is otherwiſe

So, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire himſelfe, it is rather to plot for his deſire, or bleſſe himſelfe in his purchaſe: to flatter his heart in his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie happineſſe.

                  <p>Thirdly, they differ in their Qualitie, as that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Saints before their calling are ſubiect to all ſorts of euill thoughts: yet after their calling, they are onely or eſpecially ſubiect to ſuch as concerne their calling, ſuch as oppoſe the ſame, ſuch as concerne their aberrations therein, as of hypocriſie, diſtruſt, World-lines: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the wicked are vſually ſubiect to ſuch euill
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:176263:81"/> thoughts as concerne their Nature, Conſtitution, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, condition of life, company, &amp;c.

                  <p>But the ſpecial difference is in regard of the iſſue, and effects thereof, as that euill thoughts in the godly breed humiliation, feare, watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, examining of theyr hearts, iudgeing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, Prayer, longing

                  <p>And ſo, though we haue more time giuen for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſions, and therefore may imagine that wee now haue abilitie to let looſe our thoughts vpon them: yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no creature of God is good, vnleſſe it be ſanctified by the Word and Prayer, therefore the holy heart labours to make all thinges pure and holy thereto, by ſanctifying the ſame. Hence it followeth, that a wiſe Chriſtian labours to bee a Law vnto himſelfe, euen in his outward libertie, vſing
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:176263:207"/> the world, as if hee vſed it not, and though his minde may be imployed in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſions, yet it is not ſet vpon them: Neyther doth hee beginne them with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall occaſions but in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods wil, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to glorifie him therein, as to lay vp a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereby againſt the life to come. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 16.19.

                  <p>AS the Saints of God are in generall troubled with the maruellous preuayling of corruption in their beſt actions, and ſo are not regenerate, becauſe their thoughts are more conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about euill then good, ſo more ſpecially their night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts &amp; imaginations doe moſt diſtract them herein, as ſeeming to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the truth of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:176263:209"/> becauſe either they repreſent ſuch actions as they doe not at all, and ſo may charge them of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, or elſe ofttimes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuch things as are mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and fearefull, ſuch as cannot ſtand with a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heart: Very needful ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that ſome ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be yeelded vnto them in this behalfe, that ſo they may not bee caſt from their hold in grace.</p>
                  <p>To this ende theſe three things are to be reſolued.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 What is the Nature of Dreames.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 What are the kindes of them, and ſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 How farre wee are to take notice of them, and take heed thereof.</p>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:176263:209"/>
                  <p>Concerning the nature of Dreames, they are generally ſuch thoughts and motions of the minde, wherewith it is exerciſed when the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſes are bound, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding principally from the condition thereof, which is immortall, and therefore are operatiue, when the bodily faculties are ſuſpended, and are varyed according to the ſeuerall occaſions of them, which are either naturall, as the conſtitution thereof, in regard of it calling, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, of diet, conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe ſupernaturall, and this is threefold, either ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſpirituall calling, exreciſed in the day, Or ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:176263:210"/> inſpiration from the Lord to foretell things to come, or to bring to minde things paſt.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe ſome deceitfull iniection of Sathan, affecting the minde with ſome moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things paſt, or to come: or ſuch as are not competent thereto, and ſo either diſtracting with falſe feare, or elſe puffing vp with conceit of ſuch things as are aboue our compaſſe, that thereby we may deceiue our ſelues and others. Out of which difference of occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s we may determine of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond poynt. Namely, the difference of Dreames.</p>
                  <p>Which are either natural, ſuch as proceede from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, condition, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,

                  <p n="3">3 Or diuine, ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from reuelation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Or Satanicall, ſuch as ariſe from Satans power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting ſtrange imaginations and ſo affecting the minde diuerſly thereby.</p>
                  <p>And ſo out of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of dreames we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be ſatisfied in the laſt point how farre we are to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and regard the ſame: and that by theſe conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 By the difference of theſe dreames.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 By the true iudgement of them, how far they now ſtand in force.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 By the renuing and multiplying of them.</p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:176263:211"/>
                  <p>Concerning the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe Dreames, whereas ſome are naturall, as ſuch which proceede from naturall cauſes, namely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of body, condition of life, conuerſation, &amp;c. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſupernaturall.</p>
                  <p>Here the firſt rule of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions is, that though thoſe which proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are inuincible, yet ſeeing this is alterbale by the condition of life, eſpecially by renued conuerſation, therefore they are not altogether to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, as arguing our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued nature, which euen in the very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from what it was and ſhould be, but wee are to be humbled for them by repentance. Eſpecially ſeeing
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:176263:211"/> they often produce ſuch euill actions, euen in our ſleepe, of luſt anger, &amp;c. as are abominable, and though they bee of good things, yet breede diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and confuſion of our happineſſe, in that when we awake, now are an hungrie, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 28.7. diſappointed of what we dreamt of, and ſo confounded therein.</p>
                  <p>Yet herein alſo to bee comforted that being but dreames, if they be of euill, wee did not fully conſent to them: if of good, though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, yet wee may bee recompenced with greater goodneſſe: wee haue yet time to procure that waking which in our dreames wee miſſed, or elſe to obtaine a
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:176263:212"/> greater good, to turne our dreames into conſtant prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of holineſſe, that ſo our dreames may be more pure, and our dayly carriage may bee more ſpirituall and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with our God, That our righteouſnes may not be a dreame, and ſo vaniſh acordingly: as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe dreams thogh they bee naturall, yet doe conuince natures corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo make vs inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if wee will not bee ſchooled by them, as being a part of Gods ordinance, to awaken vs out of ſinne. <hi>Iob.</hi> 33, 15.

Which as it may guid vs to reiect al ſuch predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:176263:213"/> of things to come, as proceede from no better warrant, then our dreames and fancies; becauſe at the beſt they are no better, then the illuſions of Sathan: ſo ſeeing the Lord teacheth vs as well in the night as in the day, according to what wee haue eyther done or hearde in the day: therefore though wee may not reſt vpon ſuch dreames, as preſume to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell things to come, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then wee haue beene informed by the word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euen a true dreame of thinges that fall out accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, may bee a deluſion vnto vs, to prouoke vs to the contempt of the Word; if by the Word wee haue not beene enformed thereof: or
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:176263:213"/> deſire not to trie the ſame therby; yet muſt we not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neglect eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what our dream calleth to mind either paſt or done, or to be heard: ſeing this may be the mercy of God hereby to bring vs to repentance for ſome euil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Eſpecially, if it pleaſe the Lord to multiplie our dreames, that wee often harpe vpon the ſame ſtring: Here it is beſt to bee more regardfull of them, as being now happily ſome motions of the Spirit, calling vpon

                  <p>So that though wee may not expect ordinarilie any ſuch extraordinary Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by dreames; yet if it pleaſe God (as who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine his power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe herein, to acquaint vs hereby with ſome occaſions to come, which may tend
